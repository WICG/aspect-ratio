# aspect-ratio
This is a repo to explore, and hopefully define a way to maintain aspect ratio

# Usecases
... see issues, we should end up with a few here ...

- Prevent content pushing from layout reflows by implementing aspect-ratio sized box [demo](http://daverupert.com/2015/12/intrinsic-placeholders-with-picture/)
- Prevent content pushing when `picture` aspect-ratio changes [demo](http://daverupert.com/2012/04/uncle-daves-ol-padded-box/)

# Potential solution
Jonathan Kingston already has a decent proposal here for it to work in CSS: https://jonathankingston.github.io/logical-sizing-properties/#propdef-aspect-ratio

# Meetings
We discussed this issue at TPAC, here are the minutes: http://www.w3.org/2016/09/21-respimg-minutes.html
